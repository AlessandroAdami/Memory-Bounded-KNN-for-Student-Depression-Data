    "This work was done during the Summer Reaserch Experiences program at the University of British Columbia Mathematics department. The topic of interest for this reaserch is the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm. More specifically the goal was to try and overcome the main challenges KNN faces when used with datasets with a large number of points $n$. When $n$ is large not only does KNN encounter some memory issue, but it becomes solwer in its predictions.\n"

    "- Store all examples and their labels from the training set in memory.\n",
    "- To predict the label of an unseen example $x$:\n",
    "    - Calculate the distances between $x$ and every training example.\n",
